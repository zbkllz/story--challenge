In one of the lower-class neighborhoods near the West Gate, Viv Finner and her husband Trehan, proprietors of the Poison Apple Pub, are frightened.\nEveryone knew Trehan was a magus. They knew it as much from the twinkle in his eye and his perpetual smirk as they did from the fact that he could put a rowdy customer to sleep with a handful of dust. But no one seemed to mind. Most Gate Passers didnâ€™t trust magi as a group, but just about everybody who knew Trehan Finner liked him.\n\nWith ${text}'s hands cupping a warm mug of cider, he look up at Trehan and smile. He returns the smile and winks, carefully wiping down the bar with a stained rag. He leans in and mumbles something to ${text} and his heart sinks."`}
